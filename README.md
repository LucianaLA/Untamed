How to play
This is a survival RPG, the goal is to survive for as long as possible in an unfamiliar environment with limited tools at your disposal.

Look around by moving your mouse
To move use WASD keys on the keyboard
To sprint, hold Left Shift and move using WASD
To jump, press the Space bar
The game currently contains enemies which will pursue and attack once near enough, if the enemy touches the player, health will be depleted
There is food scattered around the map, walk into them to replenish hunger
Enemies will drop energy crystals which can be collected to release a stronger attack
Once a player obtains a new weapon, it can be switched by using the keys 1-4
Use E to open inventory and F to enhance existing weapons and Q to drop a weapon from inventory
Chickens are friendly NPCs which when killed replenish health
Once the hunger reaches 0, the health will also go down and you will lose the game

The game has 3 difficulty levels which the player can pick from and 3 different levels to clear the game
To switch levels, approach a nearby portal
To toggle settings, press P

Go wild, untamed child!
