## How to play

This is a survival RPG, the goal is to survive for as long as possible in an unfamiliar environment with limited tools at your disposal.

- Look around by moving your mouse
- To move use WASD keys on the keyboard
- To sprint, hold Left Shift and move using WASD
- To jump, press the Space bar

The game currently contains enemies which will pursue and attack once near enough, if the enemy touches the player, health will be depleted.
There is food scattered around the map, walk into them to replenish hunger.

Once the hunger reaches 0, the health will also go down and you will lose the game.

Go wild, untamed child!
